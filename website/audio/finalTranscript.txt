 When I was one in twenty, I heard a wise man say, Give crowns and pounds and kidneys, but not your heart away. It grows away in diamonds, but keep your fancy free. That I was one in twenty. What do you still talk to me? When I was 120, I didn't sit again. The heart of the buzzing is still giving pain. It's so alive. So in this room I was 220. Oh, it is true, it is true. I'm going to put it on the top right corner.
